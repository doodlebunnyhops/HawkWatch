# HawkWatch

![](/images/hawk1.png)

**HawkWatch** is a Discord bot that tracks Roblox game updates and alerts your server when changes happen — like new thumbnails, updated names, or secret patch notes. Stay informed in real time!

> Ideal for Roblox fans, gaming communities, and anyone who wants to know what’s new, fast.

## 👀 Why Use HawkWatch?

Most bots can post announcements — but HawkWatch watches *actual change*.  
Whether it’s a quiet thumbnail swap, a stealthy dev push, or a surprise patch, HawkWatch catches it.

From the moment you start watching, you get a **historical trail** of how your favorite games evolve — one update at a time.  
It’s like a personal changelog for the games you care about most.

Stay ahead. Stay curious. Stay informed.

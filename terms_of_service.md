# ðŸ“œ Terms of Service

## 1. What HawkWatch Does

HawkWatch is a Discord bot that notifies your server when a watched Roblox game:
- Is updated  
- Has a name, description, or thumbnail change  

Servers can track up to **5 games**.  
If a game is unwatched, a **1-hour cooldown** applies before watching a new game â€” unless re-watching the same one (no cooldown in that case).

## 2. Who Can Use the Bot

Bot setup can be managed by:
- The **Server Owner**  
- Members with the **Administrator** permission  
- Roles named **admin** (case-insensitive)  

_Customizable roles will be supported in future updates._  
Servers are responsible for controlling who sees the bot's messages via channel permissions.

## 3. Acceptable Use

Please do not abuse the bot. Prohibited behavior includes:
- Spamming watch/unwatch commands  
- Circumventing cooldowns  
- Hosting misleading copies or modifying the code without permission  

HawkWatch may restrict access to servers engaging in abuse.

## 4. Availability

The bot aims for **99.999% uptime**.  
Most outages are due to **Roblox API incidents**, which are outside our control.

## 5. Updates and Changes

Updates will be announced via:
- [Support server news channel](https://discord.gg/fxhXWgxcHV)  
- [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/doodlebunnyhops/HawkWatch/tree/main)

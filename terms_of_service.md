# üìú Terms of Service  
**Last updated: July 20, 2025**

These Terms govern your use of the HawkWatch Discord bot. By inviting HawkWatch to your server or interacting with its features, you agree to these terms.

---

## 1. What HawkWatch Does

HawkWatch is a Discord bot that notifies your server when a watched Roblox game:

- Is updated  
- Has a name, description, or thumbnail change  

Servers can track up to **5 games** by default.  
If a game is unwatched, a **1-hour cooldown** applies before watching a new game ‚Äî unless re-watching the **same** game (no cooldown in that case).

---

## 2. Who Can Use the Bot

Bot setup and management may be performed by:

- The **Server Owner**  
- Members with the **Administrator** permission  
- Roles named `admin` (case-insensitive)  

> *Customizable role permissions will be supported in a future update.*  
Servers are responsible for managing who sees the bot‚Äôs messages using standard Discord channel permissions.

---

## 3. Acceptable Use

To ensure stable service for everyone, please do not abuse the bot.  
**Prohibited behavior includes:**

- Spamming `/watch` or `/unwatch` commands  
- Circumventing cooldowns  
- Intentionally triggering excessive alerts or misusing commands  

HawkWatch may restrict access to servers engaging in abuse.

> If you believe your server was restricted unfairly, you may request a review through the [support server](https://discord.gg/fxhXWgxcHV).

## 4. Availability

HawkWatch is offered **as-is**, and while we strive to maintain high availability and reliability, we do not guarantee uninterrupted service.

Temporary disruptions may occur due to:
- Scheduled maintenance  
- Hosting provider downtime  
- Discord API incidents or rate limits  
- Roblox API outages or platform changes  

We actively monitor uptime and attempt to resolve issues quickly, but no specific uptime guarantee is made.

Updates to the bot or these Terms will be announced through:

- The [HawkWatch support server news channel](https://discord.gg/fxhXWgxcHV)  
- The [official GitHub documentation](https://github.com/doodlebunnyhops/HawkWatch)

If changes to these Terms are **material**, we will provide at least **7 days‚Äô notice** before they take effect.

By continuing to use the bot after updates are published, you agree to the revised terms.

---

## 6. Platform Terms

By using HawkWatch, you also agree to:

- [Discord Terms of Service and Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/terms)  
- [Roblox Terms of Use and Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410)  

Use of HawkWatch to violate these platform terms may result in denial of service.

HawkWatch currently offers all features for free.  
If premium features are introduced in the future, this document will be updated to describe:

- What premium features are offered  
- How payment or verification works  
- How premium-related data is handled  

All premium-related changes will follow the same 7-day notice policy.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties

We do not guarantee uninterrupted service, error-free behavior, or that the bot will meet all needs or expectations.
